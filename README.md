This repository is devoted for my personal purposes, primarily practicing Git and programming with openGL

Since this is a testing project, I tested it only on fedora
To run it, one needs to install the packages glew-devel and glfw-devel using dnf
Compilation commands can be found in makefile 
(I don't really understand many of these steps, but they somehow work)

The test.cpp file is not part of project but is for testing C++ features

I have been following primarily the tutorial on this website https://learnopengl.com/
