This repository is devoted for my personal purposes, primarily practicing Git and programming with openGL

Since this is a testing project, I tested it only on fedora.
To run it, one needs to install the packages `glew-devel` and `glfw-devel`.
Compilation commands can be found in makefile.

The `test.cpp` file is not part of project and is used only for testing certain C++ features.

I have been following primarily (but not exclusively) the tutorial on this website https://learnopengl.com/
